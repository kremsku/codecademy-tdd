Struggled alot with the feature test. The routing part with Express was really straightforward for me, and dealing with Item creation.

Not really sure if the feature test actually tests correct stuff, but it does go through.

For a real-world case, I'd have the id of the created item returned after the creation (before redirect) and then dynamically create url to click.
